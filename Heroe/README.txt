2.Main Idea

We wanted to develop a game that is fun, challenging and intriging.
The purpose of the game is to be easy to play but still hard enough to be interesting.
So Heroe was born.(Or atleast the idea.)

3.About Heroe

To play the game you must make a registration. To register you must write your Username, First Name, Last Name and Password.
In order to play the game you must log in with your registration. After clicking the button "PLAY" you would have to choose a gamemode.
Heroe has three gamemodes:

1) Arcade

This gamemode contains a field that the character (Heroe) can move in. This field is surrounded by tanks which goal is to fire at Heroe.
The more you play the harder it gets to survive.
The goal is to survive as long as you can.

2) Survival

This gamemode like Arcade has a field in which Heroe can move in. The field will brake in time.
The goal is to avoid the broken blocks and survive as long as you can.

3) Learning

This gamemode can be used to teach little kids the alphabet.
The field is made of blocks containing letters from the alphabet. In certain intervals a letter will pop-up.
The goal is to reach the block containing the alphabet.
